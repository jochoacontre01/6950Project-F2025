# IPCC climte scenarios: how our decissions are shaping our future

## Objective

Analyze the changes in temperature and its relationship with carbon emissions and sea ice concentration around the coasts of Newfounldand, Canada, under historical changes and different climatic outcomes.

## Methodology

Using the open data from the CMIP6, part of the IPCC efforts to provide meaningful climate data, we analyze how the global temperatures relate to the global carbon emissions, and how they affect the sea ice concentration on susceptible areas, such as the coasts of Newfoundland.

The project consists on analyzing gridded data for multiple variables and timelines (from 1950 to 2050), using data analysis and libraries such as `xarray`, `numpy`, as well as API calls and file management.

## Expected results

Timeline of changes of temperature, carbon emissions and sea icea concentration under historical and projected scenarios, to compare what are the possible outcomes given our current political and environmental decisions.

 - You can check the open data in [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/projections-cmip6?tab=overview).
 - The IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, part of the United Nations, dedicated to environmental research for policy makers. The IPCC only compiles the most recent scientific concensus on climate change and does not make their own research.
 - The CMIP6 is the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, a project of the World Climate Research Programme providing climate projections to understand past, present and future climate changes.
